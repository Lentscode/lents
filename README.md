# Lents package for Dart/Flutter

Package that provides a lot of useful ready-to-use widgets and classes for Dart/Flutter projects.

It is built upon the Dart and Flutter library and other packages like ```cloud_firestore``` for Firestore and ```algolia_flutter_helper``` for Algolia.
It simply provides a faster and simple way to do multiple things common in a project, like fetching data from Algolia or Firestore, or displaying the profile image of a user.
